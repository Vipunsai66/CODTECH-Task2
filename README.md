Overview Of the Project

Project: Predictive Modeling With Linear Regression

Objective

The objective of Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression is to use historical data topredict or estimate a continuous numerical outcome based on 
one or more input features (independent variables). Linear regression models aim to capture the linear relationship between the input features and the 
target variable (dependent variable).

Key Activities:
*Data Collection-Collect relevant data from sources such as databases, APIs, surveys, or experiments.
*Data Preprocessing- Data Cleaning,Feature Scaling,Outlier Detection and Removal
*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*Splitting Data

Technologies used

*Programming Languages-Python, R, Java,MATLAB,Julia
*Libraries and Frameworks- pandas, numpy,Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn,TensorFlow and PyTorch, R libraries
*Data Preprocessing and Handling Tools-SQL,Apache Hadoop and Spark,Excel
*Data Visualization Tools
*Model Deployment Tools
